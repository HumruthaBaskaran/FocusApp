# FocusApp

This App helps us to focus on a particular activity for a given time.
You have to type the activty name and choose the number of minutes you wanted to focus on that activity.
Then the timer will keep running and once the click hits 0, the mobile will vibrate to notify that we are done.
Then this activity will be added to the focused list.
This focused list will have all the activities that we have focused on in the past.
